Test that if you're logged in the navbar displays the correct things:
- if you're not logged in
- if you're logged in and a non-matcher
- if you're logged in and a matcher
Check that when you're trying to login that:
- you can login with the correct deets
- an appropriate error displays when you have the wrong deets
- an appropriate error displays when you have no internet
- an appropriate error displays when you get a non-200 response
Check that when you login you get redirected appropriately:
- to /matcher-home if you're a matcher
- to /profile if you're a non-matcher
- to /protected-route for both matchers and non-matchers, if you hit a 401 there and were sent to login
